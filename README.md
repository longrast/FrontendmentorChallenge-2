## My process

In the process of doing my work I have difficulties with event listeners. I would be very grateful if someone could show by an example of my work how to put event listeners for each button using array.forEach and addEventListener inside.

### Built with

- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic JS

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable with JS.
